\section{Introduction to Lists and Vectors}\label{sec:list-vectors}
Clojure provides many ways of storing data. 
\elenacomment{Add a transition.} 

 \fut{Collections} are containers for storing data. There many types of collections, each suited to store data for a specific set of purposes. Every type of collections has a particular implementation in computer memory: its elements are stored in a specific way. Some collections allow faster access to data, some allow better ways of indexing it, some store data in a specific order, and some in a set-like fashion in which the order of elements does not matter. 

If you read Clojure documentation or examples, you will notice that people frequently mention \fut{sequences}. Sometimes the terms ``collection'' and ``sequence"' seem to be used interchangeably. While there are many situations in which you can refer to the same data container as a collection or a sequence, they are not the same. A \fut{sequence} is not any concrete collection, but an abstraction. It refers to the ability to get elements from a collection (as well as from other sources, such as user input) in a \fut{sequential} manner: a fancy word for getting elements \fut{one at a time}. It does not matter how elements are stored internally: if you get the same elements in the same order from two containers, they are equal as sequences.

We will discuss collections and sequences more in the future, but for now remember that while both collections and sequences are used to describe data containers, \takeaway{collections refer to a concrete way of storing data in memory} and \takeaway{sequences are an abstraction for accessing elements in a sequential manner}. 

The two types of collections that we introduce at this point are \fut{lists} and \fut{vectors}. We explain some of the differences between the two and reasons for these differences.
